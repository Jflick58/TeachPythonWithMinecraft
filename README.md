## Background
This is the repo for the Florin High School (Sacramento, CA) Python workshop at KPMG. In this workshop, you'll learn Python programming and programming concepts by writing methods to control in-game Minecraft activites, and then you will connect those actions to a Flask-based website to act as a controller. 

You'll learn: 

- Basic version control with Github
- Python Virtual Environments 
- Dependency Management 
- Flow control 
- Recursion 
- Backend Web Development concepts
